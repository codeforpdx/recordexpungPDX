# recordexpungPDX
A project to automate expunging qualifying criminal records.  This project is done in conjunction with the Multnomah County Public Defender's Office. [Learn more in the wiki](https://github.com/codeforpdx/recordexpungPDX/wiki).

This README provides a project overview, installation instructions, and links for getting started as a contributor and related resources.

## Tech Overview

This is a web app built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the in-browser interface, and a backend web service implemented with the [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) web framework in Python. The backend app connects to a [Postgres database](https://www.postgresql.org/).

The app is deployed on the webapp hosting service, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

Our latest dev version (this repo's master branch) is publicly viewable! Here: https://recordexpungpdx.herokuapp.com/

**Our dev environment** is entirely containerized with Docker, and no other dependencies need to be installed natively. We use Python's [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/en/latest/) for maintaining backend dependencies. We use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) to type check any optional typings and [pytest](https://pytest.org/en/latest/) to test backend code. We use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to develop and build the frontend code. Docker is used to build and deploy the app stack for both local development and for deployment to the web. A postgres database runs as a service within the docker stack, which exposes a connection locally for development and testing.

## Installation

You can get your dev environment up and running with installing only Docker and docker-compose. The npm and backend dev servers run in docker containers, synced with source code directories so that code changes propagate on the local servers right away. If you have any trouble, don't hesitate to ask on our [Slack channel](https://codeforpdx.slack.com/#record_expung)!

1. **[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#fork-an-example-repository)**,
  and **[clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork)** the repo.


2. Install docker

   * **Mac**

        - Follow installation instructions in: [Getting Started -- Docker on Mac OS X](https://medium.com/allenhwkim/getting-started-docker-on-mac-os-x-72c64670464a)

          (click on Get Docker for Mac [Stable])

   * **Linux**

        - First, follow: [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)

        - Configure your user to run docker without sudo: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/

   * **Windows**
        - Unfortunately, we don't have documentation to support development in Windows. If you use Windows, we'd love your contribution here!

3. Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Running the docker stack

In the project's root directory, run `make dev_up`. This builds the dev version of the docker images and launches the containers using docker-compose. Stop the running stack with `make dev_down`.

After running `make dev_up`, you can navigate to `localhost` in the browser and see the frontend running.  You can now log in using either of the following credentials

* Email: admin@email.com, Password: admin
* Email: user@email.com, Password: user

If you run docker ps, you can see a front end running on `localhost:3000`, however if you try logging while not on just `localhost`, you will get a 500 server error.

If you need to rebuild the project (for example if you add new dependencies to the frontend or backend services), you can run the `make dev_build` command.

For more project documentation on Docker, some troubleshooting, and some basic commands, see:
[doc/docker.md](https://github.com/codeforpdx/recordexpungPDX/blob/master/doc/docker.md)

##### Cleaning

While in the directory of your local repo, run:

```
$ make clean
```
in order to remove build artifacts.


## Testing

Currently using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for testing the backend.
Run all tests by running the following command in the project root directory:

```
$ make dev_test
```

This runs a `pytest` command to execute all the unit tests inside the backend docker container. All of these tests should pass if you have correctly set up the backend dev environment.

There are also make targets to operate in a docker container interactively:

```
make bash_backend
```

or

```
make bash_frontend
```


which opens a bash shell inside the respective container. In the backend container, you can then run the python interactive shell with `python3`, or run `pytest`.

To run a subset of test cases without first shelling into the docker container, you can use a docker `exec` command, which specifies a container by name and a runnable command in the container in a single step, e.g.:

```
docker exec -t expungeservice pytest ./tests/[subdir]
```

To specify and run a subset of the test cases.
