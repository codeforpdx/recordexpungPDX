### Disclaimer:
RecordSponge is not your lawyer. The results below should be used as a guide only. If you are relying on this information to expunge your record, please email roe@qiu-qiulaw.com for free consultation.  \n



### Assumptions
<b>1) Successful completion of court requirements</b> &nbsp; If you are currently on probation or conditional discharge, the analysis below assumes that you will successfully complete those requirements.  \n
<b>2) Court debt paid off</b> &nbsp; You must pay off all court debt on a case before you file for expungement on any case which you are otherwise eligible to expunge.  \n
<b>3) No records outside of Oregon State court from last ten years</b> &nbsp; We are only able to access your public Oregon records. Your analysis may be different if you have had cases from <b>within the last ten years</b> which were:  \n
  * from States besides Oregon
  * from Federal Court (in any State)
  * from local District Courts, e.g. Medford Municipal Court (not Jackson Circuit Court)
  * already expunged 

Below is a summary of your eligibility for expungement based on the assumptions above. 
If the above assumptions are not true for you and you would like an updated analysis, email roe@qiu-qiulaw.com with your name and date of birth with subject line, “Updated Analysis”.
