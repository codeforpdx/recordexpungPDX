// This Action and Middleware is a sort of implementation detail of the API Service needed
// to allow API Requests to interact with the application state via the Redux store.
export interface RequestAction {

// This is a custom Middleware that does three things:
// - Actually calls axios to make requests created with apiService
// - Adds the Authorization header to requests where request.authenticated is true
// - Check that we're actually logged in before making an 'authenticated' request
//
// The goal of this Middleware is to handle request authentication with all state managed
// in the Store, and without extra work from application code. apiService now requires the
// dispatch function as a first argument, but because apiService still returns a promise,
// this is a relatively flexible approach that doesn't require you to put *all* state in the
// Store. For a similar but different approach (with more state in the Store) see
// https://auth0.com/blog/secure-your-react-and-redux-app-with-jwt-authentication/
//
// If, for example, someone decides to add persistent sessions (you stay logged in even if
// you refresh the page) this Middleware makes it easier to do so. Note that storing a JWT
// in the Store or in Local Storage is vulnerable to XSS.
//
// Can't figure out the types here for the moment. Help is welcome!
