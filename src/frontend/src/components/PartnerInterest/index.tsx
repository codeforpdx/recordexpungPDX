                RecordSponge is made for organizations to become expungement service providers. We provide both the software and supervision by volunteer attorneys â€“ organizations provide the clients and, to a large extent, the expungement service.

                We are therefore looking to partner with organizations who have contact with many people with criminal records. If you would like to learn more about partnering please get in contact below.
