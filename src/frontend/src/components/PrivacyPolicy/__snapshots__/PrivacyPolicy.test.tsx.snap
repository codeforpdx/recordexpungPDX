        Privacy Policy
      </h1>
      <p
        className="mb3"

        Our privacy policy is simple and meant to be read by all of our users. Please email michael@qiu-qiulaw.com if anything is unclear.

        What we collect and why
      </h2>
      <p
        className="mb3"
      >
        Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need, and we will not sell your data. Here’s what that means in practice:
      </p>
      <h3
        className="fw7 mb2"
      >
        Search “pings” to track usage
      </h3>
      <p
        className="mb3"
      >
        The only information we collect are user search “pings,” which tells us when (and only when) a user has made a search. We collect this information to track usage rates. That’s it.
      </p>
      <h3
        className="fw7 mb2"

        Cookies

        Voluntary correspondence
      </h3>
      <p
        className="mb3"
      >
        When you write RecordSponge with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.
      </p>

        What we don't collect
      </h2>
      <p
        className="mb3"
      >
        We care about the privacy of your clients’ criminal records. Indeed, this project’s purpose is to make these records more private. Therefore, RecordSponge does not record or collect search information. If you are using this software for clients, we have no way of identifying who they are.
      </p>
      <p
        className="mb3"
      >
        We do not save your Oregon eCourt Case Information (OECI) login credentials. That’s why we must separately log in to OECI every time you use RecordSponge.
