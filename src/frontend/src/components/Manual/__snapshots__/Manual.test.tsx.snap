          RecordSponge only deals with adult criminal records. Juvenile records are eligible on a different basis,

          <li

            The juvenile record is 5+ years old and the client hasn’t had subsequent criminal cases.
          </li>
          <li
            className="mb2"
          >
            The client requests a hearing and demonstrates that it would be in the “best interests of justice” to expunge the record.

        RecordSponge only has access to online records of Oregon’s Circuit courts. However, having an open case or a conviction
         
        <strong>
          anywhere
        </strong>
         within the last 7 years could affect eligibility. The accuracy of the expungement analysis depends on these assumptions:

        <li

            <li
              className="mt1 mb2"
            >
              A person with an open case is not eligible. For example, a person with a warrant is ineligible.

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li
          className="fw7 mb3"

          The client does not, within the last 7 years, have cases which are:

              Cases closed more than 7 years ago, in any court, do not affect eligibility.

              className="mb3"

              Traffic ticket sdo not count. However, convictions for misdemeanor or felony traffic cases, such as Driving While Suspended, count.

            <li
              className="mb3"
            >
              Previously expunged cases affect expungement eligibility. Accordingly, RecoredSponge’s analysis may not be accurate if a person has a case previously expunged, and that case is from the last 7 years. Note that this rule does not prevent a person from filing for expungement multiple times within the same 7 year period.
            </li>
            <li
              className="mb3"
            >
              Again, beware of convictions for misdemeanor/felony traffic violations, e.g. Beaverton Municipal Court (not Washington Circuit Court), Troutdale Municipal Court, Medford Municipal Court, These courts generally handle low-level crimes and especially traffic crimes. We only need to worry about misdemeanor and felonies, including for Driving While Suspended.

          Courts often input incorrect information, and certain cases will not show all results. If an anticipated case does not show, also perform a search of the person’s first initial followed by a *, the person’s first three letters of their last name followed by a *, and their date of birth. For example, a search for Michael Zhang with birthdate 5/9/1993 would be M*, Zhang*, 5/9/1993.

          Regarding names with two letter starters, e.g. Mc, De, Di, the online court system will inconsistently input the two-letter starter as following with a space or no space. For example, McDonald could be input as Mc Donald (with a space) or McDonald (without a space). You would therefore need to search under both forms of the name to see which the court system has used.

          If there is an open charge, the affected charges will show multiple possible eligibity timeframes. Once the open charge is closed then the analysis will update. You can edit the open charges to see how the eligibility will be affected.

          Sometimes, there is not enough information on the OECI website to determine whether or not a case is eligible. RecordSponge will then prompt the user to answer questions, and the analysis will update based on those answers.

          The specific charge is not eligible under the current law because it is not “type-eligible.” The reason why the charge is not type-eligible is different for each charge. This is not conditional on the Assumption.

              Why Edit

                Sometimes the result of a Search doesn’t completely match a person’s true record. This can happen for a few reasons:
              </p>
              <ol
                className="mh4"
              >
                <li
                  className="mb3 pb1"
                >
                  The search returns the wrong person’s record: In the rare event that a different person’s Oregon record shares a birth date and name with the person of interest, these records may appear in the search result.
                </li>
                <li
                  className="mb3 pb1"
                >
                  One or more of a person’s cases cannot be found: If the record has a typo in the name or the incorrect birth date, it can be difficult to locate by searching OECI.
                </li>
                <li
                  className="mb3 pb1"
                >
                  A charge date or other piece of information for a particular case is missing or incorrect in OECI.
                </li>
                <li
                  className="mb3 pb1"
                >
                  The expungement analyzer could not classify the charge: Many of the records in OECI are older and have statutes that have been renumbered or repealed; or a charge has an irregular name not recognized by our analyzer.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p
                className="mb3"
              >
                If any of these issues appear in the record, they can be corrected with the Editing feature. You can also use the Editing feature to build a record from scratch and run an analysis without relying on OECI at all. Editing is built directly in to the main Search feature.
