                <p className="mb3">
                  Courts often input incorrect information, and certain cases
                  will not show all results. If an anticipated case does not
                  show, also perform a search of the person’s first initial
                  followed by a *, the person’s first three letters of their
                  last name followed by a *, and their date of birth. For
                  example, a search for Michael Zhang with birthdate 5/9/1993
                  would be M*, Zhang*, 5/9/1993.

                  Regarding names with two letter starters, e.g. Mc, De, Di, the
                  online court system will inconsistently input the two-letter
                  starter as following with a space or no space. For example,
                  McDonald could be input as Mc Donald (with a space) or
                  McDonald (without a space). You would therefore need to search
                  under both forms of the name to see which the court system has
                  used.

              <p className="mb3">
                If a charge is marked as eligible, it is eligible for

                  <p>
                    This assumption is redundant with an assumption needed for
                    correct Analysis, but bears repeating here. A charge is not
                    eligible for expungement if they owe money on the case,
                    including for associated probation fees. RecordSponge can
                    find court-imposed fines and fees, but does not have access
                    to probation fines and fees.

                    The charge is not associated with a separate case which led

                    If a case is dismissed, but then re-charged as a different
                    case (including in Federal court), you must file for
                    expungement on both cases at the same time. If the
                    re-charged case is not eligible, then neither is the case
                    that is associated with it. A common situation is for a
                    State-level drug-manufacturing case to be dismissed so that
                    it can be re-charged at the Federal level. In this case, the
                    State-level dismissal is not eligible because Federal crimes
                    generally are not eligible for expungement.

                    The charge did not result in a probation revocation. If the

                    RecordSponge can generally tell if a probation revocation
                    occurred. However, the online courts are inconsistent in
                    displaying this information. Ensure that a probation
                    revocation did not occurred within the last ten years simply
                    by asking the client.

                FAQ
              </h2>
              <p className="mb3">
                Due to the complexity of the Oregon expungement laws, incorrect
                information proliferates from State actors at all levels of the
                justice system.
              </p>
              <p className="mb3">
                Below are some common myths overheard in courtrooms all over
                Oregon.
              </p>
              <ol className="ml4 mb4">

                  <p className="fw7 mb3">
                    Myth: “After you complete this diversion program, there will
                    be no record of your case.”
                  </p>
                  <p className="fw7 mb3">
                    Fact 1: Without affirmatively expunging your case, it will
                    still appear on your record.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb3">
                    Oregon courts
                    <strong> never </strong>
                    expunge adult criminal records on their own.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb3">
                    When you successfully complete a diversion program,
                    oftentimes your case is dismissed - but that doesn’t mean it
                    “goes away.” Your entire case file – including records of
                    arrest, police reports, pleadings – are still publicly
                    available. Records of arrest are potentially just as
                    damaging on a housing or job application as records of
                    conviction.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb3">
                    Moreover, a dismissed case is not even eligible if you have
                    a conviction within the last ten years, or an un-expunged
                    dismissed case from the last three years.
                  </p>
                  <p className="fw7 mb3">
                    Fact 2: DUII diversion dismissals are specifically
                    ineligible for expungement.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb3">
                    Judges, DAs, and defense attorneys administering the DUII
                    diversion program sometimes say outright that successful
                    completion means that the case will disappear from your
                    record. This is not true under current law, which
                    specifically makes completion of DUII diversion ineligible
                    for expungement.

                  <p className="fw7 mb3">
                    Fact: Time-eligibility is complicated but in general has
                    nothing to do with “seven years.”
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb3">
                    The “seven-year” rule is thrown around a lot and has no
                    basis in law or practice.

                  <p className="mb2">
                    There are many concurrent rules governing time-eligibility.

                  <ul className="ml4 mb3">
                    <li className="mb2">
                      A case is not eligible unless you have no other
                      convictions from the last ten (10) years
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb2">
                      A conviction is not eligible unless the case is, itself,
                      at least three (3) years old
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb2">
                      A dismissal is not eligible unless you have no other

                    Myth: “No one is ever eligible for expungement.”
                  </p>
                  <p className="fw7 mb3">
                    Fact: About 25% of people with criminal records are
                    currently eligible to expunge their entire records, and many
                    more are eligible at a future date.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb3">
                    From my (Michael Zhang) experience, about one quarter of
                    people who inquire into their eligibility are already
                    eligible, and in fact have been for a long time. From my
                    conversations with people, it seems that so few people take
                    the initiative to inquire into their eligibility because
                    they either assume that expungement is unavailable or
                    because fees for expungement lawyers are so high.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb3">
                    In fact, Oregon has one of the most permissive expungement
                    statutes in the country. Yet the complexity of the law and
                    the filing procedures effectively bar most people from
                    accessing its benefits.

                Privacy Policy
              </h2>
              <p className="mb3">
                Our privacy policy is simple and meant to be read by all of our
                users. Please email michael@qiu-qiulaw.com if anything is
                unclear.
              </p>
              <h3 className="f4 fw7 mb2">What we collect and why</h3>
              <p className="mb3">
                Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need, and we
                will not sell your data. Here’s what that means in practice:
              </p>
              <h4 className="fw7 mb2">Search “pings” to track usage</h4>
              <p className="mb3">
                The only information we collect are user search “pings,” which
                tells us when (and only when) a user has made a search. We
                collect this information to track usage rates. That’s it.
              </p>
              <h4 className="fw7 mb2">Cookies</h4>
              <p className="mb3">
                We use persistent first-party cookies to support necessary
                functions of the application. A cookie is a piece of text stored
                by your browser to help it remember your login information, site

                in your own browser. To learn more about cookies, including how

                .
              </p>
              <h4 className="fw7 mb2">Voluntary correspondence</h4>
              <p className="mb3">
                When you write RecordSponge with a question or to ask for help,
                we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so
                that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if
                you reach out in the future.
              </p>
              <h3 className="f4 fw7 mb2">What we don't collect</h3>
              <p className="mb3">
                We care about the privacy of your clients’ criminal records.
                Indeed, this project’s purpose is to make these records more
                private. Therefore, RecordSponge does not record or collect
                search information. If you are using this software for clients,
                we have no way of identifying who they are.
              </p>
              <p className="mb3">
                We do not save your Oregon eCourt Case Information (OECI) login
                credentials. That’s why we must separately log in to OECI every
                time you use RecordSponge.
              </p>
              <h3 className="f4 fw7 mb2">How we secure your data</h3>
              <p className="mb3">
                All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our
                servers to your browser.
              </p>
