                <p className="mb3">
                  Courts often input incorrect information, and certain cases
                  will not show all results. If an anticipated case does not
                  show, also perform a search of the person’s first initial
                  followed by a *, the person’s first three letters of their
                  last name followed by a *, and their date of birth. For
                  example, a search for Michael Zhang with birthdate 5/9/1993
                  would be M*, Zhang*, 5/9/1993.
                </p>
                <p className="mb2">
                  Regarding names with two letter starters, e.g. Mc, De, Di, the
                  online court system will inconsistently input the two-letter
                  starter as following with a space or no space. For example,
                  McDonald could be input as Mc Donald (with a space) or
                  McDonald (without a space). You would therefore need to search
                  under both forms of the name to see which the court system has
                  used.
