                  Sometimes the result of a Search doesn’t completely match a
                  person’s true record. This can happen for a few reasons:
                </p>
                <ol className="mh4">
                  <li className="mb3 pb1">
                    The search returns the wrong person’s record: In the rare
                    event that a different person’s Oregon record shares a birth
                    date and name with the person of interest, these records may
                    appear in the search result.
                  </li>
                  <li className="mb3 pb1">
                    One or more of a person’s cases cannot be found: If the record
                    has a typo in the name or the incorrect birth date, it can be
                    difficult to locate by searching OECI.
                  </li>
                  <li className="mb3 pb1">
                    A charge date or other piece of information for a particular
                    case is missing or incorrect in OECI.
                  </li>
                  <li className="mb3 pb1">
                    The expungement analyzer could not classify the charge: Many
                    of the records in OECI are older and have statutes that have
                    been renumbered or repealed; or a charge has an irregular name
                    not recognized by our analyzer.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p className="mb3">
                  If any of these issues appear in the record, they can be
                  corrected with the Editing feature. You can also use the Editing
                  feature to build a record from scratch and run an analysis
                  without relying on OECI at all. Editing is built directly in to
                  the main Search feature.

                  You can now perform the following actions to change the contents
                  of the record. These changes exist only temporarily in your
                  session and will disappear if you run another search. The edits
                  will persist if you navigate between Search and the Manual or
                  other pages on recordsponge.com, but they will disappear if you
                  leave the website.
