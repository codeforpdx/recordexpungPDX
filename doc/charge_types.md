# Charge Types
The expungement system defines this custom set of charge types, to compute their correct type eligibility."
## Civil Offense
Expungement, generally speaking, only applies to criminal offenses. Civil offenses and administrative procedures – even those subject to punishments including jail time – are not eligible for expungement. The distinction between criminal and civil charges is far from clear. See, e.g. Brown v. Multnomah County Dist. Court, 570 P. 2d 52 - Or: Supreme Court 1977 ('There is no easy test for when the imposition of a sanction is a "criminal prosecution" within the meaning of the constitutional guarantees.') However, at least the following are not eligible under the expungement statute:
 * Contempt of Court
 * Extradition/Fugitive Complaint
 * Parking tickets
 These charges are ineligible even if they are marked as Violations or some other level that would normally qualify them as eligible.


## Dismissed Criminal Charge
All non-duii criminal charges that are dismissed fall under this charge type.

## DUII
A DUII conviction is not eligible for expungement, as it is considered a traffic violation.
A DUII dismissal resulting from completion of diversion (paying a fine, victim's impact panel, drug and alcohol assessment) is also not eligible under ORS 137.225(8)(b).
HOWEVER, a DUII dismissal resulting from a Not Guilty verdict at trial, or is otherwise dismissed other than through diversion, is type-eligible like other dismissals.
Therefore, to determine whether a dismissal is eligible, ask the client whether their case was dismissed through diversion or by a Not Guilty verdict or some way other than through diversion.


## Diverted DUII
A DUII dismissal resulting from completion of diversion is ineligible under ORS 137.225(8)(b).

## Felony Class A
Class A felony convictions generally are omitted from the statute, and are ineligible, unless that Class A Felony was related to the Manufacturing/Delivery/Possession of Marijuana.
Class A felony dismissals are always eligible under 137.225(5)(a).


## Felony Class B
Class B felony dismissals are always eligible under 137.225(5)(a).
Class B felony convictions are generally eligible but subject to additional restrictions compared to other charge types, as listed in 137.225(5)(a).
The extra restrictions are:
 * An extended time restriction: the class B felony is ineligible until 20 years after its date of conviction.
 * The class B felony is ineligible if the person has been arrested or convicted for any crime, other than a traffic violation, following the date of the class B felony conviction.
 * If the charge is also classified as a [Person Crime](manual/charge-types#personcrime) it is ineligible.
If a class B felony is eligible under any other subsection of the statute, that eligibility takes precedences and the extra restrictions here are ignored. The alternate positive criteria that can apply to B felonies are:
 * Some class B felonies fall under [Subsection 6](#Subsection6) or [Subsection 12](#Subsection12), which take precendence over 137.225(5)(a).
 * If the class B felony is punishable as a misdemeanor, it is eligible under 137.225(5)(b).

## Felony Class C
There are certain types of Class C felony which are generally ineligible, including sex crimes, child
abuse, elder abuse, traffic crimes, and criminally negligent homicide. Other Class C felony convictions are almost
always eligible under 137.225(5)(b).
Class C felony dismissals are always eligible under 137.225(1)(b).

## Juvenile
Juvenile records do not follow the general expungement rules. They are governed by a completely separate statute, ORS 419A.260 and 419A.262. We do not include them in our expungement analysis because information related to the cases is generally not available online, and the process for expunging these records is very different. Below is a summary of the juvenile expungement law.

In general, Under 419A.262(8), anyone can file for a motion for expungement in juvenile cases. The motion will then go to a contested hearing. Then “the juvenile court, after a hearing when the matter is contested, may order expunction of all or any part of the person’s record if it finds that to do so would be in the best interests of the person and the public.”

The hearing will not be contested if a person meets certain narrow criteria:

    1. At least five years have elapsed since the date of the person’s most recent termination;
    2. Since the date of the most recent termination, the person has not been convicted of a felony or a Class A misdemeanor
    3. No proceedings seeking a criminal conviction or an adjudication in a juvenile court are pending against the person
    4. The person is not within the jurisdiction of any juvenile court on the basis of a petition alleging an act or behavior as defined in ORS 419B.100
    5. The juvenile department is not aware of any pending investigation of the conduct of the person by any law enforcement agency.

Additionally, under 419A.262(3)(B), cases for prostitution are automatically eligible for expungement if the person was 18 years or younger at the time of the conduct, and under 419A.262(9), “Romeo and Juliet” cases are eligible for expungement.

The list of charges in ORS 419A.260(1)(d)(J) excludes certain charges from expungement eligibility. These charges generally would not be juvenile records since Oregon’s “Measure 11” requires the defendants in such cases to be charged as adults.

## Marijuana Eligible
ORS 137.226 makes eligible additional marijuana-related charges - in particular, those crimes which are now considered minor felonies or below.
    One way to identify a marijuana crime is if it has the statute section 475860.
    Also if "marijuana", "marij", or "mj" are in the charge name, we conclude it's a marijuana eligible charge (after filtering out MarijuanaIneligible charges by statute).

## Marijuana Eligible (Below age 21)
Under ORS 137.226, marijuana convictions where the offender was under the age of 21 are eligible for conviction in a year assuming their record has no other charges.

## Marijuana Ineligible
ORS 137.226 makes eligible additional marijuana-related charges - in particular, those crimes which are now considered minor felonies or below. However, there are certain marijuana-related crimes which are still considered major felonies. These are:

475B.359 Arson incident to manufacture of cannabinoid extract in first degree
475B.367 Causing another person to ingest marijuana
475B.371 Administration to another person under 18 years of age
167.262: Use of minor in controlled substance or marijuana item offense

## Misdemeanor
Convictions for misdemeanors are generally eligible under ORS 137.225(5)(b).
Exceptions include convictions related to sex, child and elder abuse, and driving, including DUII

Dismissals for misdemeanors are generally eligible under ORS 137.225(1)(b). Exceptions include cases dismissed due to successful completion of DUII diversion.

## Parking Ticket
Parking Tickets are not eligible. ORS 137.225(7)(a) specifically prohibits expungement of convicted traffic offenses. No other section specifically allows for parking offenses to be eligible.

## Person Felony Class B
If a [Class B Felony](#FelonyClassB) is also defined as a person felony under Oregon law, it is type-ineligible.
A person felony is defined in section 14 of this page: (https://secure.sos.state.or.us/oard/displayDivisionRules.action?selectedDivision=712)
Dismissal of a person felony is eligible as usual under 137.225(1)(b).
A person felony that is below a class B felony is not considered under this subsection and lower levels of charge may still be eligible, with the exceptions named elsewhere such as in [Subsection 6](#Subsection6).


## Sex Crime
Sex Crimes are type-ineligible for expungement other than a narrow exception for "Romeo and Juliet" cases.
For further detail, see 137.225(6)(a)

## 137.225(6)(f) related sex crime
In some cases, a statutory rape charge may be eligible for a young offender. Please contact michael@qiu-qiulaw.com for manual analysis.

## 137.225(6)(f) related sex crime
See other entry for this charge type

## Subsection 6
Subsection (6) names five felony statutes that have specific circumstances of the case under which they are ineligible.
However, two of the statutes named -- 163.165(1)(h) (Assault in the third degree)
This subsection also specifies conditions under which [SexCrimes](#SexCrime) are eligible or ineligible.
The three remaining specifications in the statute are:
 * 163.200 (Criminal mistreatment II) is ineligible if the victim at the time of the crime was 65 years of age or older; otherwise eligible as a (Class A) [Misdemeanor](#Misdemeanor).
 * 163.205 (Criminal mistreatment I) is ineligible if the victim at the time of the crime was 65 years of age or older or a minor; otherwise eligible as a [Class C Felony](#FelonyClassC).
 * 163.575 (Endangering the welfare of a minor) (1)(a) is ineligible when the offense constitutes child abuse as defined in ORS 419B.005 (Definitions); otherwise eligible as a (Class A) [Misdemeanor](#Misdemeanor).
 * 163.145 (Criminally negligent homicide) is ineligible when that offense was punishable as a Class C felony.

## Traffic Offense
A conviction for a State or municipal traffic offense is not eligible for expungement. Common convictions under this category include Driving While Suspended/Revoked, Possession of a Stolen Vehicle, Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants, and Failure to Perform Duties of a Driver.

## Traffic Violation
Convictions for traffic-related offenses are not eligible for expungement under ORS 137.225(7)(a). This includes Violations, Misdemeanors, and Felonies. Traffic-related charges include Reckless Driving, Driving While Suspended, DUII, Failure to Perform Duties of a Driver, Giving False Information to a Police Officer (when in a car), Fleeing/Attempting to Elude a Police Officer, Possession of a Stolen Vehicle
Notably, Unauthorized Use of a Vehicle is not considered a traffic offense.
Dismissed traffic-related Violations are not eligible for expungement
HOWEVER, dismissed traffic-related Misdemeanors and Felonies, like all dismissed Misdemeanors and Felonies, ARE eligible for expungement.

## Unclassified
RecordSponge was not able to read this charge based on the information provided in the online records, and is therefore unable to determine its eligibility for expungement. Furthermore, if the conviction date was within the last ten years, your expungement analysis for your other cases may not be correct.

## Violation
Violation convictions are eligible under ORS 137.225(5)(d).
Examples include Fare Violation, Minor in Possession of Alcohol, Failure to Send or Maintain a Child in School.
However, traffic violations are ineligible under (7)(a).
Moreover, certain civil matters are not considered violations and are thus not eligible: Contempt of Court, Extradition.
Dismissed violations are ineligible because they are omitted from the expungement statute.
