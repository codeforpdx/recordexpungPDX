## Felony Class B
Class B felony dismissals are always eligible under 137.225(5)(a).
Class B felony convictions are generally eligible but subject to additional restrictions compared to other charge types, as listed in 137.225(5)(a).
The extra restrictions are:
 * An extended time restriction: the class B felony is ineligible until 20 years after its date of conviction.
 * The class B felony is ineligible if the person has been arrested or convicted for any crime, other than a traffic violation, following the date of the class B felony conviction.
 * If the charge is also classified as a [Person Crime](manual/charge-types#personcrime) it is ineligible.
If a class B felony is eligible under any other subsection of the statute, that eligibility takes precedences and the extra restrictions here are ignored. The alternate positive criteria that can apply to B felonies are:
 * If the class B felony can be classified as [Subsection12](#Subsection12), or [Subsection6](#Subsection6).
 * or, If the Class B felony is punishable as a misdemeanor, it is eligible under 137.225(5)(b).
Applicable subsections: 137.225(5)(a) for convictions; 137.225(5)(a) for dismissals; 137.225(5)(b) provides an additional positive criterion for convictions.

## Subsection 6
Subsection (6) names five felony statutes that have specific circumstances of the case under which they are ineligible.
However, two of the statutes named -- 163.165(1)(h) (Assault in the third degree) and 163.205 (Criminal mistreatment in the first degree) are also named in subection 12 as eligible. Subsection 12 is interpreted to override other statutes, so in effect this clause of subsection 6 has no effect on eligibility.
This subsection also specifies conditions under which [SexCrimes](#SexCrime) are eligible or ineligible.
The three remaining specifications in the statute are:
 * 163.200 (Criminal mistreatment in the second degree) is ineligible if the victim at the time of the crime was 65 years of age or older; otherwise eligible as a (Class A) [Misdemeanor](#Misdemeanor).
 * 163.575 (Endangering the welfare of a minor) (1)(a) is ineligible when the offense constitutes child abuse as defined in ORS 419B.005 (Definitions); otherwise eligible as a (Class A) [Misdemeanor](#Misdemeanor).
 * 163.145 (Criminally negligent homicide) is ineligible when that offense was punishable as a Class C felony.
Applicable subsections: 137.225(6) for convictions; 137.225(1)(b) for dismissals.

## Subsection 12
Subsection (12) names 13 felony statutes that are interpreted as eligible (or conditionally eligible, in the case of 163.525, Incest).
The subsection describes an irregular criterion for eligibility: Conviction of these charges is eligible unless the court or DA provide reason they should *not* be expunged. This is in contrast to most expungements, for which the person needs to "convince" the court that expungement is in the interest of justice.
The subsection also says that the listed felonies need to otherwise meet eligibility under the other expungement rules. In practice, this actually is never considered and the listed felonies are considered all eligible. Overall, the subsection is confusing and seems a little nonsensical, but the State has generally settled on expunging any of these charges.
Applicable subsections: 137.225(12) for convictions; 137.225(1)(b) for dismissals.
