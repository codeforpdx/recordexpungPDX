Project Stack
-------------

The app stack is deployed as three services in a Docker stack:

[ Web Server ]  -- Nginx, https enabled. Serves static pages and proxies API calls

[ Backend API ] -- Python, Flask, Psycopg

[ Database ] -- PostgreSQL


Project Layout
--------------

`Makefile`: GNU Makefile controlling installing dependencies and running the application

`Pipfile`: `Pipenv` file listing project dependencies

`config`: Project configuration files

`doc`: Developer-generated documentation

`src`: Source dir

`src/backend/expungeservice/app.py`: Flask application


User Flow
---------

User visits login page in browser

User types email and password to log in

User is directed to main page

User has option to search, view stats, or log out

If user chooses search:

- User enters search terms

- Service logs into remote site

- Service does search on remote site

- Remote site returns HTML page of results

- Service scrapes results

- Service parses scraped results

- Service makes decision based on Expunge Rules

- Service inserts records into database

- User is directed to page of pretty-fied scraped results

- User has option to search again, view stats, or log out


If user chooses stats:

- User is directed to stats page showing XYZ statistics


If user chooses log out:

- User is logged out of system
    * Session cookie is invalidated

- User is directed to login page


Frontend Routes
---------------

These routes are set up in the front-end application for navigating between the different views.

`/login`

Login page

- Form for entering `email` and `password`
- Application sends credentials to server
- Server validates credentials
- If credentials are good server returns session cookie (contents tbd)
- If credentails are not good server returns `401` or `422`

`/main`

Main page

- Search: search remote system
- Stats: view statistics of data
- Log out: log out of system


`/search`

Search page

- Form for entering first name, last name, dob
- Shows results of search

`/stats`

Page for viewing statistics


`/admin`

Admin page for creating users

- email
- password
- admin permissions (T/F)


Backend Endpoints

    * auth_token


 Status codes:

- `201 CREATED`: auth token creation successful
- `401 UNAUTHORIZED`: unable to create auth token: invalid email / password

**`POST`** `/api/oeci_login/`

Requires a user authentication token.

Attempts to log into the OECI web portal with the provided username and password. If successful, closes the session with OECI and returns those credientials encrypted in a cookie. No "logged in" state is maintained with the remote site. Instead, subsequent calls to the /api/search endpoint use the encrypted credentials to log in again before performing the search. Credentials are encrypted with Fernet cipher using the app's `JWT_SECRET_KEY` attribute as the symmetric key.

- `401 UNAUTHORIZED`: authorization rejected; missing or invalid auth token
- `401 UNAUTHORIZED`: oeci authorization rejected; incorrect username or password


**`POST`** `/api/search`

Requires a user authentication token.

Performs search of remote system, using the search params provided in the request body. The oeci_login
endpoint must get called beforehand to obtain the oeci_token cookie.

Database Schema
---------------

Tables:

    users (uuid, email, admin, date_created, date_modified), uuid primary key

    auth (uuid, hashed_password, user_id), uuid primary key

    result_codes (uuid, code) uuid primary key

    rules (uuid, text)


Notes:

- Store passwords encrypted
- Use Postgres features for exporting JSON

Database Functions
--------------
Functions that query or update the database will be organized into a single module in the expungeservice.

    create_user(database, email, admin, hashed_password)

Insert a new user into the Users table with the given email string and admin flag, and inserts the password hash into the Auth table and link it with the User uuid. The uuid of each, and the date_created and date_updated are generated within the database.

This pair of inserts is an atomic operation, so if one fails then the other one is cancelled and has no effect.
If successful, returns an OrderedDictionary object containing the created entry. Otherwise throws the relevant error.

    get_user_by_email(database, email)

Return the user data identified by the given email string, in OrderedDictionary format. Contains the email string, hashed_password, admin flag, and the UUIDs for user and auth. If no such user exists, returns None. Throw any errors generated by the database.

    save_stats(database, email, record)

Takes a Record object which has processed by the expungement analyzer. Saves only a limited amount of information. Details tbd, but here are a few examples for tracking app usage and app impact:
 -  User activity: When a search is performed, log the username and timestamp; but not the search parameters.
  - Expunged charges: record the individual charges, by their crime level, some eligibility information, and the month that the search was performed.
     * An inexact timestamp makes it hard to reconstruct a complete record which could then be de-anonymized.
     * Eligibility information could be kept vague, e.g, only "eligible", "not eligible", "time-eligible", and "undetermined", as opposed to keeping the detailed analysis returned by the expunger.
